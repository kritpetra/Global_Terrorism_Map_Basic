However, these observations only show that a present-day terrorist group is likely to have religion as a driving ideology, and not that having religion as a driving ideology makes it likely for a group to be a terrorist group.\n\nWe will be trying to understand if religion has any influence on terrorism. Ideally, we would like to look at the religions of groups that have the potential to commit acts of terrorism and see if groups of a certain religion are more likely to follow through. However, there are a couple problems with this: finding data on the ideological motivation for the individuals behind the terrorist acts can be difficult, and we have no way of studying what potential terrorist groups look like, since they don't commit acts and are thus not recorded as terrorists.\n    \nInstead, we will study the most common religion of a country and the number of terrorist acts in that country as proxies for terrorist groups and the acts they commit. This is a reasonable proxy because most acts of terrorism happen locally (Smith, Damphousse, & Roberts, 2006, p. 2). In addition to using a proxy, there are other weaknesses in our method: the primary religion of a country is only likely (not certain) to be the religion of the attacker or the victim, the attacks may have nothing to do with religious motivation, and we do not have a way to control for prevalence of religions. For example, if the most terrorism takes place in Christian countries, but most countries are Christian, then there isn't a strong connection between Christianity and terrorism. \n    \nFor our data, we will use the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd) (GTD). The GTD contains information about more than 125,000 terrorist incidents occurring between 1970 and 2013, although data files from 1993 were lost by the company originally managing the database, so data from this year are missing. The data in the GTD is gathered from news reports, which means it might not be the most comprehensive. The team managing the database tries to verify all the information they gather through multiple news sources (LaFree, Dugan, & Miller, 2015). Since the GTD does not contain information on country religions, we found that data in the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html#198). We use the 2014 religion data for the entire span of the GTD, under the assumption that the major religion of a country will not shift frequently. ~~Since we are dealing with lots of information, we constructed an [app](http://rstudio.grinnell.edu/Global%20Terrorism%20Scatterplot/) to help visualize the data.~~ \n\n###Part $\\Omega$: Visualizing Spatial and Temporal Patterns with a Map\n\nA good, intuitive way to start looking at the data and understanding some of the underlying patterns would be to use a map to see each incident located both in space and time.\nGo to http://rstudio.grinnell.edu and select the [Global Terrorism Map](http://rstudio.grinnell.edu/Global%20Terrorism%20Map/). You will see a map of countries, overlaid by incident markers of different sizes. The size of each marker represents the severity of the attack (a weighted sum of the deaths and injuries caused by the incident). You can hover over a country to see various statistics for that country in that year, and you can click on a marker to see the details for that incident. You may also want to play around with the map options to gain a familiarity with the application.\n\nThings we can see using the map:\n\n - We can color-code countries by their dominant religion. Does it seem to be more terrorism in countries with a Muslim majority than those without? Try looking at different years. Does your answer change depending on the year you are looking at?\n - Try clicking on some incidents and read the details that show up. How many of them actually seem to be religiously motivated, as opposed to just taking place in a Muslim country? \n - Also: notice that most Muslim countries are concentrated in one geographical region: the Middle East and North Africa. How might this observation influence conclusions which say that Islam encourages terrorism? (Region might be a confounding factor.)\n\nWhile using this map can be very useful for picking out individual incidents and getting detailed information about each one, it is more difficult to detect and verify more obscure patterns. To get a more general picture of global terrorism through time, plots which aggregate data and present overall trends will be more helpful.\n\nFor this reason, we constructed an [app](http://rstudio.grinnell.edu/Global%20Terrorism%20Scatterplot/) to help visualize the data.\n\n###Part A: Using Scatterplots to Identify Significant Events.  \n\nGo to the Grinnell College RStudio site, http://rstudio.grinnell.edu/, and select the [Global Terrorism Plots](http://rstudio.grinnell.edu/Global%20Terrorism%20Plots/). In the scatterplot, each point represents a particular country and year (referred to as a **country-year**), such as all the incidents that occurred in the US in 1984. \n\nThe X-axis contains numerous variables collected from [the Gapminder website](http://www.gapminder.org/), including: \n\n  - *Total Population*: The number of people in a country\n  - *GDP per capita*: This value is a measure for the amount of economic production that takes place in a country divided by the population.\n  - *Life Expentancy*: The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same. (Gapminder, 2014)\n  - *Female Unemployment*: Percentage of women, age 15 or older, who are unemployed. Only has data from 1991-2007.\n  - *Labour Rate*: The percentage of the population, age 15 or older, who are participating in the labor force. Only has data from 1980 to 2007.\n  - *Children per woman*: The average number of children a woman is expected to have.\n  - *Electricy per Capita*: How much electricity in generated per person in Kilowatt hours. No data for 2012, 2013.\n  - *Child Mortality*: Zero to five year-olds dying per 1,000 born\n\nThe Y-axis options are:\n\n  - *Incidents*: The total number of successful and unsuccessful terrorist attacks in a country-year.\n  - *Fatalities*: The total number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks in a given country-year. The figure includes deaths of perpetrators and is an average of the numbers given by the news reports about the event.\n  - *Wounded*: The total number of individuals wounded by terrorist attacks in a country-year. Like fatalities, wounded includes perpetrators injuried and is calculated based on the news reports of the event.\n  \nBoth the X- and Y-axes have a **Log** option which allows the scale to be changed from standard to logarithmic (base 10). Additionally, there are other options in the app that allow you to change the display or restrict the data based on your question of interest:\n\n  - **Type of Plot**: The *ggvis* version of the scatterplot allows us to hover over points and see the country, year, X-variable, and Y-variable of the data point in question. In contrast, the *ggplot* version of the scatterplot allows us to facet (create distinct plots) by *Region, Religion, Weapon Type, Attack Type, Target Type,* and *Success* with the **Facet By** menu.\n  - **Color By**: Gives the options of coloring the points by *Region* or *Religion*\n  - **Success Only**: When checked, only successful incidents are displayed. Successful means that an act of terror was committed, not that the terrorists succeeded in their goal.\n  - **Year of Incidents**: Allows you to control the years for which incidents are displayed. \n  - **Filter By...**: In the **Filters** tab (next to the **Axes** tab), there are four menus which give the option to filter the data by *Region, Attack Type, Target Type, and Weapon Type*. \n  - **Minimum Number of Incidents per Country by Year**: Found in the **Filters** tab (next to the **Axes** tab). Restricts the data to only country-years with a certain number of incidents. For example, when the minimum number of incidents is set to 100, only country-years where there were 100 or more attempted terrorist attacks will be included. \n  \n1) Select the following paramters:\n    + **X-axis variable**: *GDP Per Capita*, use **Log**\n    + **Y-axis variable**: *Incidents*, use **Log**\n    + **Year of Incidents**: 1970-2013\n    + **Color By**: *Religion*\n    \n    Notice that the countries with the most terrorist incidents are Muslim countries. However, also notice that there are a variety of religions the middle range of incidents: Islam, Catholicism, Hindu, Orthodox (Christianity), and Christianity. Look at a few of the data points with the most incidents and take note of which countries they are (Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan) and what years they are from (recent years). We may see that these countries are all countries that are engaged in ongoing conflicts at a state level, which is another possible cause for the high levels of terrorism.\n    \n2) Select the *ggplot* option for **Type of Graph** and *Religion* for **Facet By**. These graphs should confirm what we saw in the ggvis version of the graph: Islamic countries are the countries with the most incidents, but all religions have some terrorist attacks. From these graphs, we can also get some sense of how many countries there are under each religion: there aren't many Jewish countries (in fact, Israel is the only country with Judaism as the main religion) or Hindu countries, there are lots of Catholic, Christian, and Muslim Countries, and the rest are somewhere in the middle. We see that countries with no religion (None), a religion not listed (Other), or Orthodox Christianity as their primary religion tend to have fewer incidents, but they also make up fewer countries.\n\n3) Select *Fatalities* instead of *Incidents* in the **Y-axis Variable** menu. We can see that Catholic and Muslim countries have the highest number of fatalities, which makes sense given there were lots of incidents in those countries. All of the other countries, with the exception of a few outliers, still have a range of fatalities due to terrorism (ranging from 10s to 100s), but have extremes much lower than Catholic and Muslim countries. This observation might suggest that deadly terrorism is somehow linked to Catholicism and Islam as major religions for countries.\n\n    The scatterplot helped us find the religion for the countries with the most incidents, and shows that terrorism occurs at a variety of levels in countries of each religion category. However, the scatterplot does not help us account for the fact that there seem to be an increasing number of terrorism incidents in the GTD in recent years (Putting Terrorism in Context, LaFree, Dugan, & Miller). In order to control for worldwide terrorism levels, we will use the stacked-line plot. \n\n###Part B: Stacked-line Plot  \n\nAnother type of plot at our disposal is the stacked-line graph. This plot takes the data from the GTD, organizes it by year and the chosen category (*region, religion, weapon, attack type, target,* or *success*), and tallies up the number of incidents, fatalities, or wounded in the given year and category. The graphs can also be faceted (separated into different graphs) by the same variables. The Y-axis can be changed between percentage and absolute count. The stacked-line graph allows us to gain a better sense of how religions compare.\n\n1) First, select the *Stacked-line Plot* tab at the top of the app, then select the following parameters: \n    + **Y-Axis Variable**: *Incidents*\n    + **By Percentage (%)**\n    + **Color By**: *Religion*\n    + **Facet By**: *None*\n    + **Year of Incidents** 1970-2013\n\n    With the stacked-line plot, we get a  different picture: although Muslim countries had the most exteme number of incidents in the scatterplot, they only account for about 2/3s of terrorist incidents in recent years, whereas Catholic countries account for nearly 75% of terrorist acts in the 70s and 80s. This observation confirms that unusually high levels terrorism in Muslim countries is a recent phenomenon, and our observation that Catholic and Muslim countries experienced a lot of terrorism. We can see the expected low levels of terrorism in None/Other and Jewish countries from the scatterplot, but it appears that Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Chrisitian, and Hindu countries contain small, but not insignificant, portion of terrorist events. \n\n2) Change **By Percentage (%)** to **By Count (#)**, so we can look at the absolute levels of terrorism. From this change, we see that there are nearly 4 times as many terrorist incidents in Muslim countries as there were incidents in Catholic countries in the 80s. This observation tells us that, while there were proportionally more incidents in the 80s in Catholic countries than there are in recent years in Muslim countries, there is considerably more terrorism in absolute terms today than there was some 30 years ago. It is worth noting that this discrepency might also be caused by the fact that the GTD collects data through news media, and communication media are much better now than they were in the 80s (Putting Terrorism in Context, LaFree, Dugan, & Miller). \n\n    It is also worth noting that terrorism in Muslim countries was stable during the late 1990s and early 2000s, having dropped from a higher level in the mid-90s, but begins a rapid increase starting around 2003, which, incidentally, is when the Iraq war was started. This observation raises the possibility that war has been causing large amounts of terrorism, rather than religion. This hypothesis is strengthed by the previously mentioned observation that Pakistan, a country in a prolonged dispute with Israel, has one of the highest levels of terrorism and Afghanistan, another country the US invaded, is the third country with particularly high levels of terrorism. With a little knowledge of geo-political history, we can continue this thread of exploration.\n\n3) Select *Region* in the **Facet By** menu. Notice that the all countries with terrorism in Latin America and the Carribean are Catholic countries, and that the time period in which they occur corresponds to a time period of conflict for many countries in Latin America, such as the prolonged civil war in Guatemala. From this graph, we can also see that most of the countries with incidents in *the Middle East & North Africa* and *South Asia* are Muslim, which suggests that religion is related to region. *The Middle East & North Africa* and *South Asia* also happen to be the regions with the most terrorism in recent years. If we look at region and regional conflict as the root of religion and terrorism, respectively, we can explain whythere were so many terrorist incidents in Catholic countries in the 80s and in Muslim countries in recent times. \n\n4) If terrorism is related to conflict, we might expect terrorist attacks to target **Armed Forces** or **Government** in periods and regions in conflict. Select *Target Type* in the **Facet By** menu. We can see that **Armed Forces** are the primary targets in Muslim countries, suggesting that the terrorism is not caused by religion, but is likely to be caused by military presence. However, while **Armed Forces** are the most common targets for the surge of terrorism in Catholic countries, their targets are much more evenly distributed among other target types than the recent terrorism in Muslim countries, suggesting that military conflict is not a complete explanation for these countries.\n\nOur observations from the stacked-line plot help confirm some findings from the scatterplot, namely that Muslim and Catholic countries experienced the most terrorism. In fact, during their peak periods of terrorism, they account for the majority of terrorist incidents. However, we observed that we see the same patterns of terrorism in certain regions, which raises doubt that religion is the primary influence in the terrorism. We also observed that most terrorist attacks in Muslim countries are aimed at armed forces, further strengthening the idea that religion is not the primary cause for terrorism.\n    \n###Part C: Bar Graph/Histogram\n\nThe final graph we will use is the bar graph/histogram. This plot counts how many countries have a certain amount of incidents, deaths, or people wounded in a given year. There is also a play button near the slider for year selection which allows us to view each year in succession and look for trends over time. The plot displays either displays this information as two bars showing number of countries with more than or fewer than **n** incidents or in a histogram with an adjustable amount of bars. The graph can also be colored by *Religion* or *Region*. We will use the *more than/fewer than* option in the graph to study how breadth of terrorism by religion, that is how many countries have incidents or don't have incidents, rather than which countries have the most incidents.\n\n1) Select the *Stacked-line Plot* tab at the top of the app, then select the following parameters: \n    + **Y-Axis Variable**: *Incidents*\n    + **Type of range**: *Below/Above n Incidents*\n    + **Value for n**: 0\n    + **Color By**: *Religion*\n    + **Year of Incidents**: 1970\n\n    Once the settings are selected, press the play button and watch how the level of terrorism changes over time. Try to watch for some of the patterns we saw earlier. Take note of the proportion of countries that don't have terrorist incidents (and their religions) versus those that do. Overall, we can see that the early 90s and 2000s were when terrorist incidents were occurring most broadly, but usually, the majority of countries don't experience any incidents. One may notice that Judiasm always has at least one incident, but that is because only one country (Israel) has Judiasm as the primary religion, and Israel has been embroiled in a conflict with Palistine for years. \n\n    Focusing on our two religions with high terrorism, we can see that for majority of the 70s and 80s, most Muslim countries didn't have any incidents, suggesting that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam. During the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s, however, terrorism in Muslim countries was in flux: values ranged from about 3/4s of Muslim countries at times to low numbers of countries similar to the 70s. We can see a similar pattern for Catholic countries, except the low numbers of countries experiencing terrorism only lasted for the 70s (as opposed to the 70s and 80s for Muslim countries). In general, we can see that there are usually at least a fifth of Muslim and Catholic countries free of terrorism, which suggests the religion is not a primary factor in causing terrorism.\n \n2) Change **Value for n** to 20, so that we are looking at countries with a lot of terrorism. Look at a variety of years again. We find that few Muslim countries experience terrorism in the 70s and 80s, with only a handful of countries experiencing more than 20 incidents in a given year. Predictably, this value increased during the 90s and 2000s, with muslim countries accounting for about 1/4th to 1/3rd of countries with 20 incidents in a given year, although over half of muslim countries continued to have low levels of terrorism (under the 20 incident measure) during those time periods. In the 2010s, we see a similar pattern to increase observed in the river plot, where the majority of countries with at least 20 incidents in a year are Muslim. When we observe Catholic countries, we see that the for the 70s, 80s, and early 90s, a fourth to a third of Catholic countries had more than 20 incidents a year and the majority of countries with more than 20 incidents were Catholic, which matches the pattern of regional conflict we found earlier. In the late 90s and 2000s, we see high levels of terrorism in Catholic countries drop. For the other religions, we don't see more than a handful of countries experiencing more than 20 incidents in most years, suggesting a lack of connection between the main religion of a country and terrorism.\n \nOverall, the bar chart provides evidence against a connection between religion and terrorism: If there were a casual relationship between a religion and terrorism, we would expect to see at least one event in most countries of that religion most of the time. Since we do not see anything of the sort, we can conclude that religions cannot be a singular explanation for terrorism.\n\n###Part D: Drawing conclusions \n\n  Originally, we set out to see if religion had any influence on terrorism (ie. if religion was a driving motivation for committing acts of terrorism) by looking at the major religion of a country and incidents, deaths, or fatalities in that country as proxies for religion and acts of terrorism by groups, in lieu of more accurate information. With this method, we found that some religions do correspond to greater levels of terrorism, particularly Catholicism and Islam. However, this connection only applies for certain time periods (Catholicism during the 70s and 80s and Islam during the 2000s and 2010s), weakening the case that religion influences terrorism. Moreover, from the stacked-line plot, we saw that region also correlates with levels of terrorism, which raises the possibility that some factor related to region has a causal relationship with terrorism and religion is correlated with region, not terrorism itself. By looking at the bar plot, we were able to see that most countries do not experience terrorism, and most religions (with the exception of Judiasm, on account of Israel) have no incidents in the majority of their countries the majority of the time and are even more unlikely to have a large number of incidents (>20). The large amounts of terrorism in Catholic and Muslim countries showed up in the bar plot as well, although there were always some of those contries (a fifth or more) with no terrorism. Overall, we can conclude that it is unlikely that there is a connection between the primary religion of a country and terrorism levels in that country, due to the observations of most religions having low levels of terrorism and the religions correlated with high levels of terrorism being temporary.\n  \n  Clearly, there are lots of avenues for future exploration with this topic. If you wanted to stick with the same proxy, you could filter out all international incidents from the GTD to strengthen the connection between each country and the terrorists committing the acts in that country. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to find a method for controlling for the prevalence of religions and find which religion has the most terrorism compared to people of that faith. Going beyond the primary religion of a country, you could look for a relationship between [secular/religious governments](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rachelmccleary/files/state_religion.pdf) (Barro & McCleary, 2005) and terrorism or between [religious diversity](http://www.pewforum.org/2014/04/04/global-religious-diversity/) (Pew Research Center, 2014) and terrorism. Finding measures for religious extremism or dissent in countries could also be interesting measures to study for countries. Unfortunately, these ideas still only deal with the country as a whole, rather than individual terrorists or targets. However, given the difficulty of finding information on terrorists' motives, let alone the people who could have been terrorists, but chose not to be (so we can see if religion affects potential to become a terrorist), they are some of the best approximations we have for measuring the effect of religion on terrorism. \n  \n  In addition to bringing in other measures of religion, it could also be of value to do multivariable analysis comparing other socio-economic factors such as the HDI with religion to see if together they can explain the high levels of terrorism for some religions during some time periods. The GTI has already identified three factors which provide a starting point: political stability, intergroup cohesion, and legitimacy of state (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2014, p.4). Finally, if geopoltical factors (ex. civil wars) can be controlled for, it could provide evidence for a clearer connection (or lack thereof) between religion and terrorism.\n    \n#####References:      \n\nBarro, R.
